<div>
  Allows to configure a new project type "Detritus Project".
  </br>When this project is downstream of some test project,
  once the failed tests are determined the Detritus Project kicks in, and iterates revisions,
  creating a mapping between revision and test failure.
  </br>this effectively determines who broke what and when.
