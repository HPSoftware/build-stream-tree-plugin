    Divide the tests into parallel sub-tasks each no bigger than N minutes.
    Combined with elastic slaves, such as EC2, the turn-around time of the
    tests will remain the same no matter how many tests you add.

    <p>
    This value counts just the time spent on executing tests, and not including
    other time such as checking out the code, building the test, etc. For example,
    if your test job spends 50 minutes in tests and 60 minutes total from start to
    finish, then you have 10 minutes "fixed" overhead regardless of the number of tests
    it executes. If you use this mode and set the value to "10 minutes", then
    you'll have 5 parallel sub-tasks that all ends in roughly 20 minutes
    (20 mins = 10 mins tests time + 10 mins overhead.)

    <p>
    "N minutes per a sub-task" is a goal, not a hard constraint. So a sub-task
    can take longer (for example if you have a single test that takes more than
    N minutes.)
