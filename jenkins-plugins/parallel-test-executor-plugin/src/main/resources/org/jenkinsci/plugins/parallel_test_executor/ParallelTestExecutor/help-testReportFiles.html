<div>
    The GLOB syntax that specifies test reports and its associated files that need to be copied
    back into this build to tally the test reports. This includes the JUnit-compatible XML files,
    as well as files that capture stdout/stderr of those tests (if they are placed separately.)

    <p>
    The path is relative to the workspace of the test job. For Maven builds, this value is normally
    "**/target/surefire-reports/".
