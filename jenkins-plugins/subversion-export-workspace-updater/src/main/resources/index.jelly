<div>
  adds a "export from svn" option to svn workspace udpaters.
  sometimes you always clean the workspace, and if that's the case, it's pointless to do a checkout - as svn metadata
  takes a long while to calculate.
  instead, you can just export - you won't be updating since the workspace is cleaned anyway - and it's much faster.
